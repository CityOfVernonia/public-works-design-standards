### SECTION 1 - GENERAL

#### 1.0010 - AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE

The Vernonia Comprehensive Plan addresses land use and development issues within the City. This comprehensive planning document is a single document with references to many Ordinances. The Vernonia Comprehensive Plan and Subdivision Ordinance regulates the divisions of land and the creation of public facilities. The "Design Standards" section of the Subdivision Ordinance discusses generalized public facility design requirements.

The purpose of these Design Standards is to provide a consistent policy under which certain physical aspects of public facility design will be implemented. Most of the elements contained in this document are Public Works oriented and it is intended that they apply to both public improvements under City contract and public improvements under private contract designated herein.

These Design Standards cannot provide for all situations. They are intended to assist but not to substitute for competent work by design professionals. It is expected that engineers will bring to each project the best of skills from their respective disciplines.

The Design Standards are also not intended to limit unreasonably any innovative or creative effort which could result in better quality, better cost savings, or both. Any proposed departure from the Design Standards will be judged, however, on the likelihood that such variances will produce compensating or comparable result, in every way adequate for the user and City residents.

Alternate materials and methods will be considered for approval by the City Engineer as the need arises and conditions warrant modification. This consideration will be on a case-by-case basis and require sufficient justification prior to approval. (See Section 1.0050)

#### 1.0020 - ENGINEERING POLICY

It shall be the policy of the City of Vernonia to require compliance with Oregon Revised Statute Chapter 672 for professional engineers.

All engineering plans, reports, or documents shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer, or by a subordinate employee under the engineer's direction, and shall be signed by the engineer and stamped with the engineer's seal to indicate the engineer's responsibility for them. It shall be the engineer's responsibility to review any proposed public facility extension, modification, or other change with the City, prior to engineering or proposed design work, to determine any special requirements or whether the proposal is permissible. A "Preliminary Review" and/or a "Plans Approved for Construction" stamp of the City, on the plans, etc., for any job, does not in any way relieve the engineer of responsibility to meet all requirements of the City or obligation to protect life, health, and property of the public. The plan for any project shall be revised or supplemented at any time it is determined that the full requirements of the City have not been met.

#### 1.0030 - APPLICABILITY

These Design Standards shall govern all construction and upgrading of all public and privately financed public facilities in the City of Vernonia and applicable work within its service areas.

#### 1.0040 - STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS

Except as otherwise provided by these Design Standards, all construction design detail, workmanship and materials shall be in accordance with the current edition of the APWA Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, Oregon Chapter.

#### 1.0050 - APPROVAL OF ALTERNATE MATERIALS OR METHODS

Any substitution material or alternate method not explicitly approved herein will be considered for approval as set forth in Section 1.0010. Persons seeking such approvals shall make application in writing. Approval of any deviation from these Design Standards will be in written form. Approval of minor matters will be made in writing if requested.

Any alternate must meet or exceed the minimum requirements set in these Design Standards.

The written application is to include, but is not limited to, the manufacturer's specifications and testing results, design drawings, calculations, reason and justification, and other pertinent information.

Any deviations or special problems shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and approved by the City Engineer. When requested by the City, full design calculations shall be submitted for review with the request for approval.

#### 1.0060 - SPECIAL DESIGN PROBLEMS

Special applications not covered in these Design Standards require review and approval by the City Engineer. Submittal of full design calculations, supplemental drawings and information will be required prior to any approval.

Applications requiring special review and approval may include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Sewer Force Mains
* Relining of Existing Sewers
* Internal Sealing of Existing Sewers
* Sewer Regulatory Devices
* Sewage Pump Stations
* Sewer Siphons
* Sewage Treatment Plants
* Sewer Flow Measurement/Monitoring Device

#### 1.0070 - REVISIONS TO DESIGN STANDARDS

It is anticipated that revisions to these Design Standards will be made from time to time. The date appearing on the bottom of each page is the date of the latest revision. Users should apply the latest published issue to the work contemplated.

Parenthetical notations at the end of sections indicate the most recent change to those sections. All sections without. notations are from the original Design Standards as adopted. Some sections may be changed more than once, and it shall be the user's responsibility to maintain his/her copy of these Design Standards with the latest changes.
