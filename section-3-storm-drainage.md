### SECTION 3 - STORM DRAINAGE

#### 3.0010 - GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

**A. Performance Standards**

Storm drainage design within a development area must include provisions to adequately control runoff from all public and private streets and the roof, footing, and area drains of residential, multi-family, commercial, or industrial buildings. The design must ensure future extension of the drainage system to the entire drainage basin in conformance with these Design Standards. These provisions include:

1. Surface or subsurface drainage, caused or affected by the changing of the natural grade of the existing ground or removal of natural ground cover or placement of impervious surfaces, shall not be allowed to flow over adjacent public or private property in a volume or location materially different from that which existed before development occurred, but
shall be collected and conveyed in an approved manner to an approved point of disposal.
1. Surface water entering the subject property shall be received at the naturally occurring locations arid surface water exiting the subject property shall be discharged at the natural locations with adequate energy dissipaters within the subject property to minimize
downstream damage and with no diversion at any of these points.
1. The approved point of disposal for all storm water may be a storm drain, dry wells, existing open channel, creek, detention, or retention pond approved by the Superintendent of Public Works. Acceptance of suggested systems will depend upon the prevailing site conditions, capacity of existing downstream facilities, and feasibility of the alternate design.
1. When private property must be crossed in order to reach an approved point of disposal, it shall be the developer's responsibility to acquire a recorded drainage easement (of dimensions in accordance with those included in Section 3.0024). The drainage facility installed must be a closed conduit system. Temporary drainage ditch facilities, when approved, must be engineered to contain the storm water without causing erosion or other
adverse effects to the private.property.
1. The design peak discharge from the subject property may not be increased from conditions existing prior to the proposed development except where it can be satisfactorily demonstrated by the applicant that there is no adverse impact.
1. Retention/detention facilities will be required where necessary to maintain surface water discharge rates at or below the existing design storm peak discharge except where it can be demonstrated by the applicant that no adverse impart will result from not providing said facilities.
1. Minimum width of an access easement from an existing public road to a drainage facility shall be fifteen (15) feet.
1. Drainage from roofs, footings, and downspouts may drain directly to a street through the curb under the following circumstances:
    1. The building pad ground elevation is at least two (2) feet above the existing street curb, and
    1. The existing street is adequately crowned to avoid sheet flow across the street. This requirement will be waived if curb and gutter is existing or installed.
1. Vegetation shall be established on areas disturbed by/or on areas of construction as necessary to minimize erosion, in accordance with Section 3.0050 of these standards.

All storm drain system designs shall make adequate provisions for collecting all storm water runoff. The system shall accommodate all runoff from upstream tributary areas whether or not such areas are within the proposed development. The amount of runoff to be accommodated shall be based upon ultimate development of all upstream tributary areas.

Where storm drains are constructed on slopes greater than 20%, in areas designated as hazardous or where there are site conditions that may cause damage to improvements, slippage or slides or determined by the Superintendent of Public Works, a soils and/or geologic report may be required.

For erosion control requirements refer to Section 2.0130.

Where the finished graded surface has a greater than 20% slope, or as required, soil stabilization fabric shall be placed over the entire disturbed area.

Proposed storm drain systems shall not discharge flows into inadequate downstream systems unless approved by the Superintendent of Public Works.

Public storm lines shall be located within the public right-of-way as directed by the Superintendent of Public Works, per Section 3.0021. These lines are placed in the public right-of-way for ease of maintenance access, control of the facility, operation of the facility, and to provide required replacement and/or repair.

**Standard drawings relevant to this section may be found in the most current specifications and edition of the APWA Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, Oregon Chapter.**

#### 3.0011 - SITE DRAINAGE PLANS

#### 3.0024 - EASEMENTS

When it is necessary to locate storm drains in easements, the storm drain shall be centered in the easement. All storm drain easements shall be exclusive and shall not be used for any purpose which would interfere with the unrestricted use of the storm drain line. Exceptions to this requirement will be reviewed on a case by case basis, (e.g., a utility corridor in a new subdivision).

Easements for storm drain lines thirty-six inches (36") or less in diameter shall have a minimum width of fifteen feet (15').

The water bars shall be sloped slightly to drain runoff water away from the pipe line alignment. Water bars shall have a maximum spacing of forty (40) feet.

#### 3.0040 - STORM DETENTION

*no section in original document*

#### 3.0041 - DEVELOPMENT NOT REQUIRING DETENTION

In general, developments meeting the following criteria will not be required to provide detention:

1. Land divisions of less than four lots.
1. Multi-family developments of less than four units.
1. Commercial and industrial development where the construction of a new facility or expansion of an existing facility will not increase the impervious area by more than 5,000 square feet.

#### 3.0042 - FLOODPLAIN INFORMATION

Floodplain information, delineating the 100-year floodplain limits, shall be shown where it occurs within the development. Floodplain limits shall be based on maps prepared by the UPS. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (F.E.M.A.) Where better information is available, it shall be used by the Design Engineer.

#### 3.0043 - DETENTION VOLUME

When detention is required, the volume to be detained shall be based on the following:

The rate of runoff from a developed site during a 25-year recurrence interval storm shall not exceed the pre-development rate of runoff released based on a 10-year recurrence interval storm.

#### 3.0044 - EMERGENCY OVERFLOW

The Design Engineer shall assess the impacts of system failure for on-site detention. Overflows may occur due to rainfall intensity which exceeds the design storm, debris blockage of storm drain system, or some other reason.

If a system overflows, it shall not cause inundation of neighboring properties. Potential overflow routes shall be protected from erosion by adequate means.

#### 3.0045 - DETENTION FACILITIES

Detention volume storage methods in order of preference are the following:

1. Surface storage
1. Underground storage

#### 3.0050 - EROSION CONTROL

Developments shall provide erosion control methods to limit the removal of soil materials by storm runoff during the construction phases of a project.

#### 3.0051 - EROSION CONTROL APPLICATION

For subdivision plats temporary erosion control measures also shall be utilized by the applicant during installation of plat improvements and by subsequent builders during construction of dwellings and other lot improvements.

Prior to the initial clearing and grading of any land development, provisions shall be made for the interception of all potential silt-laden runoff that could result from said clearing and grading.   Said interception shall preclude any silt-laden runoff from discharging from the proposed land development to downstream properties unless previously approved by the Superintendent of Public Works. Said interception shall cause all silt-laden runoff to be conveyed by open ditch or other means to whatever temporary facility is necessary to remove silt prior to discharge to downstream properties.

Prior to initial clearing and grading of construction site, an evaluation of the following factors must be carried out:

1. Soil Erodibility - Soil credibility should be identified using Soil Conservation Service credibility ratings. Erosion control techniques shall be designed accordingly.
1. Slope and Runoff - Cleared areas will require protection from erosion.
1. Cover - Erosion protection will be required for all disturbed areas.

Temporary facilities may include silt fences, drain barriers, gravel entries, ditches, surface stabilization or other devices as necessary.

Temporary/permanent hydro-seeding or acceptable seeding and mulching must be provided whenever perennial cover cannot be established on sites which will be exposed after September 1 or prior to June 1.

#### 3.0060 - PRIVATE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS

*no section in original document*

#### 3.0061 - SUBDIVISIONS

When subdivision lots drain to the rear, it may be necessary to provide a private drainage system in private easements. This system shall be for collection of roof drains, footing drains and surface runoff. This system shall be designed to meet the Uniform Plumbing Code requirements.

#### 3.0062 - SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE

Subsurface drains (under drains) shall be provided at the following locations:

1. For all existing springs and field tile intercepted during construction activity for other facilities, i.e. sewer, water, mains, street excavations, foundations, etc. Subsurface drains are not needed if the tile is removed.
1. Where high ground water exists or when it is necessary to reduce the piezometric surface to an acceptable level to prevent land slippage or under floor flooding of buildings.
1. The drainage line installed shall begin at a clean-out and terminate at an approved point of disposal. Open jointed storm drain lines will not be considered as an acceptable solution.
